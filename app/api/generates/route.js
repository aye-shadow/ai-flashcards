export async function POST(req) {
  const apiKey = process.env.GROQ_LLAMA3_API;
  const groq = new Groq({ apiKey });

  const data = await req.text();

  const completion = await groq.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
      { role: "user", content: data },
    ],
    model: "mixtral-8x7b-32768", // Specify the model to use
    response_format: { type: "json_object" },
  });

  // console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
  // Parse the JSON response from the OpenAI API
  const flashcards = JSON.parse(completion.choices[0].message.content);

  // Return the flashcards as a JSON response
  return NextResponse.json(flashcards.flashcards);
}
